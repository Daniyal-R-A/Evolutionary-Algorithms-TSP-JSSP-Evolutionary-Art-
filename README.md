This repository explores global optimization using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), demonstrating their application in solving computationally hard problems. By engaging with these techniques, one can gain insights into the EA process, its challenges, and the impact of various parameters and selection schemes.

Problems Covered:
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) â€“ Finding the shortest route that visits all cities exactly once.
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) â€“ Optimizing task scheduling to minimize completion time.
Evolutionary Art (Mona Lisa) â€“ Using EA to generate artistic representations through mutation and selection.
This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding how evolutionary strategies can tackle real-world optimization problems. ðŸš€
